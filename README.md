# Rails 5 Api Token Authentication

This is just a basic template for anyone to download and use for setting a basic token authentication system for usage with javascript frontend frameworks such as Ember, React, Angular, etc.

## How can I help?
You don't have to, it's pretty basic code. It could probably use some tests though.
